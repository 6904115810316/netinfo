# Contributing
Any simple editorial contribution can be done with a GitHub Pull Request. You can even do an inline edit of the spec on GitHub!

For substantial contributions, either file a bug or please  start a thread in the
[mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/).

## Intellectual property
Note: The [Device APIs Working Group](www.w3.org/2009/dap/) operates under the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium
/Patent-Policy-20040205/) that  aims to enable implementations of W3C Recommendations without the need to pay royalty fees. If you want to make contributions that can be used in normative parts of our specifications, we require you to [make the appropriate licensing commitments](http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/58119/status).

## Style guide
The spec is written in markdown and generated with [ReSpec](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html).

When contributing text, just follow the conventions in the document. Please note that some GitHub flavored markdown won't work (e.g., denoting the programming language in a code block).

Please check that everything is ok locally (by opening index.html in the browser) before sending a pull request.
