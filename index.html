<section id='sotd'>

<section id="use-cases">
## Use cases and requirements
This document attempts to address the [requirements](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo/blob/master/README.md) from the <cite>[Review of Apps that Use Network Information](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo)</cite> document published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/IG/">Web and Mobile Interest Group</a>. Those are:

 * Provide access to the <a>connection type</a> the system is using to communicate with the network (e.g., cellular, bluetooth, ethernet, wifi, other, or none). This information needs to be available either immediately on page load or as close as possible to it.
 * Provide a means for scripts to be notified if the <a>connection type</a> changes. This is to allow developers to make dynamic changes to the DOM and/or inform the user that the network <a>connection type</a> has changed (and that it could impact them in some way).
</section>

<section class="informative">
## Examples of usage
For examples of the kinds of applications one can build with this API, see the <cite>[Review of Apps that Use Network Information](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/netinfo)</cite>.

<pre class="example">
// Get the connection type.
var type = navigator.connection.type;

// Get an upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop
var max = navigator.connection.downlinkMax;

function changeHandler(e) {
  // Handle change to connection here.
}

// Register for event changes.
navigator.connection.onchange = changeHandler;

// Alternatively.
navigator.connection.addEventListener('change', changeHandler);
</pre>

## Dependencies and definitions

The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#task-source">task source</a> used by this specification is the the <dfn>networking task source</dfn> [[!HTML]].

The following concepts are defined in [[!DOM]]:

 * <dfn>Queue a task</dfn>.
 * <dfn>Fire a simple event</dfn>.

For clarity, a <dfn>megabit</dfn> is 1,000,000 bits, and <dfn data-lt="Mbit/s">megabits per second</dfn> is equivalent to transferring:

* 1,000,000 bits per second
* 1,000 kilobits per second
* 125,000 bytes per second
* 125 kilobytes per second
* and so on...

</section>

<section>
## Connection types
This section defines the <dfn data-lt="connection type">connection types</dfn>:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-bluetooth">bluetooth</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using a Bluetooth connection as the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-cellular">cellular</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using a cellular connection as the <a>underlying connection technology</a> (e.g., EDGE, HSPA, LTE, etc.).</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-ethernet">ethernet</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using an Ethernet connection as the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-none">none</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent will not contact the network when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page (or knows that such an attempt would fail) - i.e., equivalent to `navigator.onLine === false` in HTML.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-wifi">wifi</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using a Wi-Fi connection as the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-wimax">wimax</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using a WiMAX connection as the underlying connection technology.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-other">other</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using a connection type that is not one of enumerated connection types as the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-mixed">mixed</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent is using multiple connection types as the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn id="dom-connectiontype-unknown">unknown</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The user agent has established a network connection, but is unable to determine what is the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.</dd>

## Extensions to the `Navigator` interface

<pre class=idl>
partial interface Navigator{
   readonly attribute NetworkInformation connection;
};
</pre>

### The `connection` attribute
The <dfn id="widl-Navigator-connection">`connection`</dfn> attribute, when getting, returns an object that implements the <a>`NetworkInformation`</a> interface.
</section>

<section>
## The `NetworkInformation` interface
The <dfn>`NetworkInformation`</dfn> interface provides a means to access information about the network connection the user agent is currently using.

<pre class="idl">
[Exposed=Window,Worker]
interface NetworkInformation : EventTarget{
  readonly attribute ConnectionType type;
  readonly attribute Megabit downlinkMax;
  attribute EventHandler onchange;
};

typedef unrestricted double Megabit;
</pre>


### `type` attribute
The <dfn id="netinfo.type">`type`</dfn> attribute, when getting, returns the <a>connection type</a> that the user agent is using.

### `downlinkMax` attribute
The <dfn>`downlinkMax`</dfn> attribute represents an <dfn>upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop</dfn>. The reported value is in <a>megabits per second</a> and determined by the properties of the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.

<div class="note">
The user agent has no knowledge of the total number or the performance characteristics of the various network hops required to fulfill a particular request; different requests may follow different routes and have different performance characteristics. The reported <a>upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop</a> value is determined by the properties of the <a>underlying connection technology</a> of the first network hop. The end-to-end performance of any request cannot exceed this value, but it is also not a guarantee of performance and may be significantly worse.
</div>

## Underlying connection technology

The relationship between an <dfn>underlying connection technology</dfn> and its <a>upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop</a> is determined by the available network interfaces that may be used to fulfill new network requests.

The <dfn>downlinkMax for an available interface</dfn> is determined via the standardized, or generally accepted, maximum download data rate captured in the <a>table of maximum downlink speeds</a>. Where possible, this value may be refined to report a more accurate upper bound based on current properties of the interface - e.g. signal strength, modulation algorithm, and other "network weather" variables.

The <a>upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop</a> is determined by the rules described in <a href="#handling-changes-to-the-underlying-connection">handling changes to the underlying connection</a>.

<div class="note">
The enumeration of available network interfaces and their generation and version is not directly exposed to script. Instead, `downlinkMax` exposes a single value in <a>megabits per second</a> that accounts for all available interfaces and their current network conditions.
</div>

<table id="max-downlink-table" class="simple">
  <caption><dfn>Table of maximum downlink speeds</dfn></caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Connection type</th>
      <th>Underlying connection technology</th>
      <th>Generation or Version</th>
      <th>Max downlink speed (<a>Mbit/s</a>)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <!-- fallback if JS disabled or xhr fails -->
      <td colspan="4"><a href="downlink.json">Data available as JSON</a>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Handling changes to the underlying connection

When the properties of the <a>underlying connection technology</a> change (e.g. due to a switch to a different <a>connection type</a>, or change in <a>upper bound on the downlink speed of the first network hop</a>), the user agent MUST run the <dfn>steps to update the connection values</dfn>:

1. Let <var>new-type</var> be the <a>connection type</a> that represents the <a>underlying connection technology</a>.
1. If <var>new-type</var> is "none", set <var>max-value</var> to `0`.
1. if <var>new-type</var> is "unknown", set <var>max-value</var> to `+Infinity`.
1. If <var>new-type</var> is "mixed", set <var>max-value</var> to an applicable value for the interface configuration used to service new network requests - e.g. if multiple interfaces may be used, sum their <a>downlinkMax for an available interface</a> values.
1. Otherwise, set <var>max-value</var> to <a>downlinkMax for an available interface</a>.
1. If <var>max-value</var> is not equal to the value of `connection.downlinkMax` or if <var>new-type</var> is not equal to the value of `connection.type`:
    1. Using the <a>networking task source</a>, <a>queue a task</a> to perform the following:
        1. Set `connection.downlinkMax` to <var>max-value</var>.
        1. Set `connection.type` to <var>new-type</var>.
        1. <a>Fire a simple event</a> named `change` at the `NetworkInformation` object.

  ## Privacy Considerations

  The Network Information API exposes information about the first network hop between the user agent and the server; specifically, the type of connection and the upper bound of the downlink speed, as well as signals whenever this information changes. Such information may be used to:

  <ul>
    <li>Fingerprint a user based on characteristics of a particular network (e.g. type and downlink estimates) at a point in time, and by observing change in such characteristics over a period of time.</li>
    <li>Fingerprint a user based on transitions between one or more networks (e.g. based on order of transitions by type, downlink estimates, and time).</li>
    <li>Infer user location (e.g. are they home, at work, or in transit) based on above criteria.</li>
  </ul>

  However, above considerations are not new, and sufficiently motivated attackers may already obtain such information using other technologies:

  <ul>
    <li>The attacker can use JavaScript to observe the duration (e.g. time from start of fetch to `onload` event) of any network fetch on the client, and may get more detailed timing data about the same fetch via the Resource Timing API.</li>
    <li>The attacker can use WebRTC to identify client's public and private IP addresses via STUN, or similar mechanisms.</li>
    <li>The attacker can observe the client IP, fetch duration, RTT, transfer speed, and other low-level socket metrics of a fetch on the server.</li>
  </ul>

  Further, by repeating one of the above strategies (e.g. via invoking periodic fetch or refresh of a resource; via periodic SSE or WebSocket messages; via periodic STUN requests, etc.), the attacker can observe changes over time in the performance characteristics of client's connection and IP address. Such data can then be used to refine the user fingerprint, infer users location (e.g. are they home, at work, or in transit), and extract various behavioral patterns.

  The above list is not a complete overview. However, as the above examples illustrate, the attacks are possible both from the sender and the receiver:

  <ul>
    <li>If the attacker can initiate or observe a network fetch of any kind from the client, then they can observe its performance characteristics and how they change over time.</li>
    <li>If the attacker can convince the client to fetch a resource from their server, then they can similarly observe the performance characteristics of the fetch and how they change over time.</li>
  </ul>

  Mitigating such attacks initiated from the client requires preventing the attacker from observing and initiating network requests - e.g., use HTTPS to prevent trivial content injection by malicious parties; disable JavaScript to prevent scripted resource fetch of any kind. Mitigating attacks from the sender is possible via the use of a VPN or an HTTP proxy - e.g. to hide the client's true IP address, to introduce additional latency, and so on.

  As such, while the Network Information API makes it easier to obtain information about the first network hop, by avoiding the need to observe or make network requests, it does not expose anything that is not already available to a sufficiently-motivated attacker.

  If the client wants to mitigate this class of attacks, they should disable JavaScript, monitor that all outbound requests are made to trusted origins, and make diligent use of anonymizing VPN/proxy services.
